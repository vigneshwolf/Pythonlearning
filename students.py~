# in this example, you have to take number of student as input, then ask marks for three subjects as physics,maths,science, if the total marks of any student is 120 then print he failed, or else say passed.

n = int(input("Enter the number of students:"))
data = {}
languages = ('Physics', 'Maths', 'History')
for i in range (0, n):
    name = input('Enter the name of the student %d: ' % (i + 1))
    marks = []
    for x in languages:
        marks.append(int(input('Enter marks of %s: ' % x)))
        data[name] = marks
for x, y in data.items():
    total = sum(y)
    print("%s 's total marks %d" % (x, total))
    if total < 120:
        print("%s failed :(' % x)
else: print("%s passed :)" % x)
