# Stacks are often known as LIFO (Last In First Out) structire. It means the data will enter into it at the end, and the last data will come out first. The easiest example can be cople of marbles in an one side closed pipe. so if you want to take the marble out of it you have to do that from the end where you inserted the last marble.

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print (a)
a.pop()
print (a)

#we learned  a new method called pop().pop(i) will take out the ith datafrom the list
