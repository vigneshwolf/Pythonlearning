Whitespaces and indentation

a = 12
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    a = 12
IndentationError: unexpected indent = In Python whitespace is an important thing. We divide different identifiers using spaces. Whitespace in the beginning of the line is known as indentation, but if you give wrong indentation it will throw an error.

We can have few basic rules ready for spaces and indentation.

    Use 4 spaces for indentation.
    Never mix tab and spaces.
    One blank line between functions.
    Two blank lines between classes.
