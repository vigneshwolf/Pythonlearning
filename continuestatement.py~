# Just like break we have another statement, continue, which skips the execution of the code after itself and goes back to start of the loop, that means it will help you to skip a part of the loop. in the below example we will ask the usr to input an integer, if the input is negative then we will ask again, if positive then we will square the number. To get out of the infinite loop user must input 0.

while True:
    n = int(input("Please enter an Integer: "))
