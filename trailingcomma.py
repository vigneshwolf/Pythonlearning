# To create a tuple which contains only value, type a trailling comma.

a = (123)
print(a)
print (type(a))

b = (123, )
print(b)
print (type(b))

#Using built in function type() you can know the data type of any variable. remember the len() function we used for find the length of any sequence?

c = (123, )
print(c)
print (type(len))
