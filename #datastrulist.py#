#At first we created a list (a). Then to add 45 at the end of the list we call the a.append(45) method. you can see that 45 is added st the end of the list. sometimes it is necessary to insert at any place within the list, for that we have insert() method.

#count(s) will return you the number of times s is in the list. Here we are going to check how many times 45 is there in the list.
